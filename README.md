# Data Engineer MSc + Cloud Pathway

## What is Data Engineering?
Data engineering focuses on building systems that collect, clean, transform,
and store data so it can be used for analytics, reporting, and machine learning.

## ETL vs ELT
ETL transforms data before loading it into a database.
ELT loads raw data first and performs transformations inside the warehouse.
Modern cloud systems prefer ELT.

## Batch vs Streaming
Batch processing handles data at scheduled intervals.
Streaming processes data in real time.
Most entry-level data engineering roles focus on batch pipelines.

## Where Cloud Fits
Cloud platforms provide scalable storage, compute, and data warehouses
used to run modern data pipelines efficiently.

## Repository Purpose
This repository documents a 14-day hands-on pathway to becoming
a Data Engineer I with strong foundations in cloud, SQL, and Python.
